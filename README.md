# Exploring_HDI_Python
 An Exploration of the UNDP's Human Development Index using Python
 
In this section of my analysis of the United Nations Development Programme, I will be focusing on the "Population Growth and Trends" table. This table includes information about general population growth, population by age group, fertility rates, and dependency ratios within different age groups. 
 
My first step included cleansing the data and eliminating countries with missing data. This is crucial to note, some of my findings may be skewed because some developing countries did not provide results. After the data was cleaned, I imported a package into Python to allow me to read from my Excel file.

Helpful terms, as defined by the UNDP:

**Young age dependency ratio**: Ratio of the population ages 0–14 to the population ages 15–64, expressed as the number of dependants per 100 people of working age (ages 15–64).

**Old-age dependency ratio**: Ratio of the population ages 65 and older to the population ages 15–64, expressed as the number of dependants per 100 people of working age (ages 15–64).

**Total fertility rate**: Number of children who would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years and bear children at each age in accordance with prevailing age-specific fertility rates.
